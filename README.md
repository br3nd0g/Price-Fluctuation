# Price Fluctuator

A small program I made quickly, inspired by a problem in a project one of my friends is creating. 

It takes an initial value (which i set as 50) and 'simulates' a fluctuation of the price, such as to mimic the stock market or such.

Randomly generates a value to add or subtract, and also has some logic that uses a random number generator to make a 1/4 chance for it to switch direction (adding or subtracting)

There is an extra file which is the exact same thing, but updated to a graph rather than printed to the console.

Really nothing special, but could be used for something interesting :)
